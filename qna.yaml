  - context: |
      The Local Projects Manual (LPM) is intended to assist non New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) transportation project
      sponsors in New York State who seek federal funding through
      the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) , as well as state funding from New York State. The LPM aims to provide
      an overview of the processes, procedures, documentation, authorizations, approvals, and certifications required
      throughout the scoping, design, construction, and maintenance of transportation-related projects. While all attempts
      have been made to create a manual as comprehensive as possible, the dynamics of federal and state policy make it
      reasonable to expect that the reader will need to have other references at hand as well.
      NYSDOT developed the procedures in cooperation with FHWA and representatives of the NYS County Highway Superintendents
      Association (NYSCHSA) and other external stakeholders. These organizations administer locally administered federal and state-aided transportation projects.
      Periodic updates are necessary to reflect changes in laws, rules, regulations, and executive orders, along with the institutional knowledge gained in the
      evolving practice of non NYSDOT administered federal and state aid transportation projects. Revision dates can typically be found in the footer of each chapter.
      The manual is intended to provide project development guidance to Sponsors, who are delegated most responsible for administering federal and state aid transportation projects.
      However, under U.S. Code Title 23, NYSDOT is ultimately responsible for federal aid transportation projects in New York State and cannot delegate its overall administrative duties,
      thereby retaining oversight authority. NYSDOT also retains ultimate responsibility for the successful implementation of non-
      federal aid locally administered transportation projects in New York State.  In order to stay current with the latest LPM
      manual, you visit the webpage at: https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/operating/opdm/local-programs-bureau/locally-administered-federal-aid-projects.

  - context: |
      Chapter 9: Design Standards and Construction Specifications describes the design standards and construction specifications used in the contract bid documents [Plans, Specifications, and Estimate (PS&E)].
      New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) design standards are based generally on American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) standards and have been approved by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)
      for use on all Federal-aid projects. The following references may be used to support justifying the inclusion or retention of nonstandard and nonconforming features (to address accident history, environmental impacts, cost to correct, etc.): • AASHTO’s A Guide for Achieving Flexibility in Highway Design (current edition) • Proposed Treatments for the Rehabilitation of the National Register Eligible Long Island Parkways, December 1997. • Recommendations of the Parkway Standard Task Force, Jan 1989 (amended 10/25/90) • NYS Scenic Byways Program: Individual Corridor Management Plans.NYSDOT publishes three types of issuances to guide engineering practice; an Engineering Directive (ED), Engineering Instruction (EI), and Engineering Bulletin (EB). Sponsors are only required to follow those issuances pertinent to their specific project or applicable to Federal-aid projects in general. Sponsors and their designers are responsible for keeping up-to-date with current issuances of EDs, EIs, and EBs.  RLPLs will do their best to keep Sponsors informed about relevant issuances coming into effect.

      ## What is the TIP?

      The Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) is a staged and financially constrained multi-year program of local/state highway, multimodal and transit projects.

      All transportation projects must be listed in the TIP to be eligible for federal and state funding, federal and state permits, and review of Environmental Impact Reports and Environmental Impact Statements.

      The GBNRTC TIP is consistent with all federal guidance and regulations, including:

      - Incorporates a Comprehensive, Cooperative, and Continuing (3C) process for initiatives to be eligible for Federal transportation funding
      - Covers a period of at least four years
      - Is developed in cooperation with the state and public transit providers
      - Identifies the timing and funding of all capital and non-capital surface transportation projects, bicycle and pedestrian facilities and other transportation enhancements, Federal Lands Highway projects, and safety projects included in the State's Strategic Highway Safety Plan
      - Is fiscally constrained
      - Includes non-federal funded projects deemed to be 'regionally significant'
      - Reflects the priorities and direction of the region and its state and federal partners in the transportation planning process
      - Supports federally defined planning factors and Transportation Program Management (TPM) goals
      - Consistency with the current Metropolitan (Long-Range) Transportation Plan (MTP/LRP)
      - Undergoes public review including at least one public meeting
      - Consistent with the air quality goals established by a State Implementation Plan (SIP)

      The GBNRTC's TIP is developed by a team led by staff from the Greater Buffalo-Niagara Regional Transportation Council (GBNRTC) and New York State Department of Transportation (Region 5).

      The Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) is a four-year listing of all projects (and their phases) in New York for which federal funding is proposed to be used. The STIP begins as a compilation of all MPO TIPs that are adopted every four years by NY Metropolitan Planning Organizations and evolves into a comprehensive list of all highway and transit projects that propose to use Federal funds. Amendments to the STIP can be made by MPOs and Regions for the subsequent State and Federal review and possible approval.

      ## Public Participation

      The GBNRTC has developed a Public Participation Plan (PPP) in consultation with all interested parties. The PPP covers a full range of opportunities for members of the public to engage in the transportation decision-making in the region, from in-person and virtual MPO meetings, social media, and other engagement events and activities. The PPP states the principles and policies that the GBNRTC has committed to for all public participation activities. This document details various opportunities and engagement approaches, including virtual formats, for public participation in the GBNRTC's planning process.

      THE GBNRTC PPP was updated in 2023 and takes into account an increased focus on environmental justice and equity in transportation planning as well as recent advances in the deployment of virtual meeting technology and online platforms. The updated PPP is an opportunity to provide guidance to ensure that all residents benefit from transportation investments and have a voice in the metropolitan planning process.

      For the TIP development process, numerous public participation will be employed, including:

      Use of email blasts, GBNRTC web site and GBNRTC social media channels to keep the public informed about the TIP development process including availability of draft documents and the announcement of public comment periods and public meetings

      Publication of draft TIP in no-cost, accessible, electronic (Adobe PDF) format as well as having hard copy available for viewing during GBNRTC office hours

      Use of visualization in Plans and Metropolitan TIP Development including maps, charts, PowerPoint slides and interactive Geographic Information Systems (GIS)

      Opportunity for interested state and regional agencies to consult and comment on the TIP

      Provide direct notice and appropriately involve the Indian/Native Nations government(s) in the development of the TIP

      Targeted engagement with stakeholders in Rural Areas
